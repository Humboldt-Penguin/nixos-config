        - Check status (if it's running/failed, uptime, errors with conf file, etc.) with: `sudo systemctl status keyd` (or `restart` instead of `status).
      - [SELF NOTES:]
        - There's some extra companion config in `home.nix` to write a home file to allow unicode symbols like em dash. When I modularize everything, I'll make that more spatially associated with this stuff.
