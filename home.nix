      My keymaps for navigation involve holding "alt", which has unintended side effects in editors like vscode/vscodium since default behavior is that holding alt highlights stuff in the menu bar. To fix this, I add the following to my "settings.json":

        ```json
        {
            "window.customMenuBarAltFocus": false,
            "window.enableMenuBarMnemonics": false,
            "window.menuBarVisibility": "compact",
            "window.titleBarStyle": "custom"
        }
        ```

      Note that there's some room for flexibility here (e.g. you can enable mnemonics, I just don't use it personally).

      TODO 1: Make it so these settings are added declaratively via home-manager.
      TODO 2: Eventually modularize my entire config and group all the keyd stuff (so it's not scattered across both "configuration.nix" and "home.nix").
