I used to use this theme: https://github.com/moistp1ckle/GitHub_Dark/

but the recent discord update broke it, as indicated by this issue :( https://github.com/moistp1ckle/GitHub_Dark/issues/20



I don't think any themes are working properly (atleast in vesktop), I'll give it some time

UPDATE: just go to settings > appearance > "onyx" theme :)

if you really want something advanced, maybe check if any of these work...? https://github.com/Danrus1100/walcord/tree/main/examples
